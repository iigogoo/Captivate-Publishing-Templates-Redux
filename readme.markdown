These files are specifically for Adobe Captivate 5.5, unless otherwise noted. (I've been informed these templates work with Captivate 5.0, but I have not tested them myself.)

SWFObject and RightClick are included in standard.js for convenience. They are each released by their respective authors under MIT-style licenses. Please visit their websites for details.

All work, edits, and additions by me (Philip Hutchison) are released under an MIT license: http://pipwerks.mit-license.org/

All else probably belongs to Adobe.


#To use these template files, do the following:

##For SCORM 2004:
1. Make a backup of your entire Adobe Captivate publishing folder (Templates\Publish) and put it somewhere safe!
2. Go to Captivate's Templates\Publish\SCORM\2004\ folder and replace Default.htm with the new file.
3. Go to Templates\Publish\SCORM\2004\SCORM_support\ and replace scorm_support.js with the new file.
4. While you're in your SCORM_support folder, delete scorm_support.htm and scorm_support.swf, they won't be used anymore.
5. Go to Templates\Publish\ and replace manifest2004.xml with the new file.
6. While you're still in the Templates\Publish\ folder, replace standard.js with the new file.
